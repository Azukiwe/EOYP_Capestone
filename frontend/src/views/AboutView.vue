        Eskom was founded in 1923. The original name was Electricity Supply
        Commission, but the name was changed to Eskom in 1987. The South African
        government set up Eskom to build and maintain an electricity network.One
        of the highlights in Eskom’s history was the creation of a national
        power network in the 1960s. South Africa’s largest power plants had been
        built in the Transvaal, a region in the northeast where coal was
        plentiful. New power lines completed in the 1960s connected the
        Transvaal power plants with the Cape region in the south.In the 1970s
        Eskom continued to build new coal-fired power plants. However, it also
        constructed new types of plants. Growing demand for power in the Western
        Cape province led Eskom to build a nuclear power station at Koeberg,
        near Cape Town. The Koeberg plant began to produce electricity in 1984.
        Hydroelectric plants at the Gariep and Vanderkloof dams began operating
        in the 1970s. Both are located on the Orange River. Construction of the
        Drakensberg pumped-storage station began in 1974 and was completed in
        1982.Eskom expanded in the 1980s with the construction of several large
        coal-fired plants. In the 1990s the company worked to make electricity
        more widely available to South African homes. In the early 2000s Eskom
        launched another expansion program to meet increasing demand for power.

        of electric power. It produces and distributes almost all of the
        electricity used in the country. It is also the largest electricity
        provider in all of Africa, generating nearly half the electricity used
        on the continent.

        Eskom saw a need in South Africa in electrical materials and saw a need
        in the community that they find it hard to communicate with technicians
        when there is a electrical problem in the community therefore eksom
        created CONNECTWITHESKOM,where users will be able to communicate and
        request a visit for technical support only.The website is designed and
        created to cater for the needs of communities and individuals. It
        acknowledges that Loadshedding is something that eskom implements from
        time to time therefore it also sells products to make loadshedding
        bearable and for users apliances to be able to function through
        loadshedding.
